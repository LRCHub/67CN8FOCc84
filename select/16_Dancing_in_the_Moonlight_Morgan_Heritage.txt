Yeah mon
Morgan Heritage you know
Under the beautiful moonlight
Oh oh oh oh
Consciously walking on the beach
Oh oh oh oh
Under the moonlight

Why we gotta make everything so complicated
Life was never meant to be that way yeah
Before it's to late, before we get too jaded
Baby we should take some time and play yeah

We'll go dancing in the moonlight
All nightlong
We'll go dancing in the moonlight
Till the break of dawn
Forget your worries and your troubles
Leave them all behind
We'll go dancing in the moonlight
Make you feel all right

Trying to make the best of a situation
Caught up in a game that you may not win
Playing by the rules with a little hesitation yeah
The best things in life don't cost a thing oh

We'll go dancing in the moonlight
All nightlong
We'll go dancing in the moonlight
Till the break of dawn
Forget your worries and your troubles
Leave them all behind
We'll go dancing in the moonlight
Make you feel all right

Yeah yeah
A warm wind is blowing through the night
Blowing
Under the vale of the star lit sky
Star lit sky
Come dance with me and we'll take flight
Oh we'll take flight
Here in the moonlight oh

Eh

Dancing in the moonlight
Dancing in the moonlight
Yeah
Oh my oh my my

We'll go dancing in the moonlight
All nightlong
We'll go dancing in the moonlight
Till the break of dawn
Forget your worries and your troubles
Leave them all behind
We'll go dancing in the moonlight
Make you feel all right

We'll go dancing in the moonlight
All nightlong
We'll go dancing in the moonlight
Till the break of dawn
Forget your worries and your troubles
Leave them all behind
We'll go dancing in the moonlight
Make you feel all right
