We get it almost every night
When that moon is
big and bright
It's a supernatural delight
Everybody's dancin'
in the moonlight
Everybody here
is out of sight
They don't barkand
they don't bite
They keep things loose
they keep things tight
Everybody's dancin'
in the moonlight
Dancin' in the moonlight
Everybody's feelin'
warm and right
It's such a fine and
natural sight
Everybody's dancin'
in the moonlight
We like our fun and
we never fight
You can dance and
stay uptight
It's a supernatural delight
Everybody was dancin'
in the moonlight
Dancin' in the moonlight
Everybody's feelin'
warm and right
It's such a fine and
natural sight
Everybody's dancin'
in the moonlight
We get it on most every night
And when that moon is
big and bright
It's a supernatural delight
Everybody's dancin'
in the moonlight
Dancin' in the moonlight
Everybody's feelin'
warm and right
It's such a fine and
natural sight
Everybody's dancin'
in the moonlight
dancin' in the moonlight
Everybody's feelin'
warm and right
It's such a fine and
natural sight
Everybody's dancin'
in the moonlight
dancin' in the moonlight
Everybody's feelin'
warm and right
It's such a fine and
natural sight
Everybody's dancin'
in the moonlight
dancin' in the moonlight
Everybody's feelin'
warm and right
It's such a fine and
natural sight
Everybody's dancin'
in the moonlight
dancin' in the moonlight
Everybody's feelin'
warm and right
It's such a fine and
natural sight
Everybody's dancin'
in the moonlight
